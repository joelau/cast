## Introduction

- Ethics = morality
    - What is the most important question in ethics?
    - German philosopher Kant: “What should I do?”
    - A normative question about what we OUGHT to do, all things considered.
    - Not a descriptive question about what we ACTUALLY do.
- A simple answer
    - We should do the RIGHT thing.

- Moral objectivity
    - Objectivism: There are correct answers about what we ought to do.
        - There are wrong answers too.
        - Does not mean there is always only ONE correct answer.
    - Subjectivism: There is NEVER a correct answer.
        - Subjective moral judgments are neither true nor false.
        - Nothing is objectively right or wrong.
- Moral objectivity is often assumed.
    - Many laws are justified (but not all) moral rules are enforced by law, eg. harm to others.
    - Many professional [codes of conduct](https://ethics.acm.org/code-of-ethics/software-engineering-code/) seem to assume moral objectivity.
    - There is increasing expectations of businesses acting ethical, eg. CSR and ESG.

## Moral relativism

- A popular version of subjectivism.
    - Morality is not objective.
    - What is right / good is relative
    - To people, points of view, value systems, society.
    - Compare: relativity in standards of taste.
- Motivation #1: Diversity
    - “Different people / society / culture have different beliefs.”
    - Widespread disagreement about morality.
    - Appeal to history / anthropology.
    - However
        - Differences in opinion is compatible with objectivity.
        - There is commonality that underlies diversity.
        - Not everything goes.
        - Existence of clear cases and moral progress.
- Motivation #2: Anti-absolutism
    - Pluralism: “There are many ways of living a meaningful life.”
    - Rejection of absolutism
        - An action is either always right or always wrong.
        - Kant: Lying is always wrong.
    - But objectivity is compatible with >1 correct answer.
        - Compare: navigation.
        - Meaningful debates in ethics presuppose objectivity.
- Rejection of moral absolutes
    - Moral objectivity does not require accepting absolutism.
    - Rejecting absolutism does not require accepting relativism.
    - Many people confuse relativism with contextualism.
    - Contextualism: Right and wrong depends on the situation.
    - Example: Is it wrong to lie?
    - Absolutism: You should always tell the truth.
    - Contextualism: The correct answer depends on the situation.
    - Relativism: There is never a correct answer.
- Legal perspective
    - Many actions are prohibited without exception.
    - Example: UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (>170 signatories)
    - Also: slavery, genocide, child pornography, …
    - Such legal prohibitions are often associated with moral justifications.
    - For example, appeal to universal human rights.
    - Key issue: Is right and wrong determined only by consequences?

## Consequentialism

- Different versions of consequentialism
    - Action: intentional → behavior → consequences.
    - Right thing to do depends only on the consequences.
    - Nothing else matters.
    - “The ends justifies the means.”
    - Implication: nothing is absolutely right / wrong.
    - A form of cost / benefit analysis.
    - Needs a framework for comparing moral value of consequences.
- Utilitarianism
    - Most famous version of consequentialism.
    - Key figures: Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832) and John Stuart Mill (1806-1873).
    - Bentham: “the greatest happiness of the greatest number”.
    - Reaction against intuitionistic and religious moral frameworks.
    - Right thing to do is to maximize utility.
    - Utility: Net balance of happiness over suffering.
    - Inspires modern “effective altruism” movement.
    - Mozi (墨子) as a utilitarian? 興天下之利
- Types of utility
    - Bentham: pleasure vs. pain.
    - Mill: “higher” vs “lower” pleasures.
    - Hedonistic vs. preference utilitarianism.
- Objection: Utilitarianism violates rights
    - Maximising utility might infringe people’s rights.
    - Allows unjust exploitation of individuals.
    - A problem for ACT utilitarianism
    - What about [RULE utilitarianism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequentialism-rule/)?
    - Right action = action that conforms to utility-maximizing rule.
    - A system of rules that protect rights might promote more utility in the long run.
- [Many other objections](https://utilitarianism.net/objections-to-utilitarianism/)
    - The [utility monster](https://conversableeconomist.blogspot.com/2019/08/robert-nozick-utility-monsters-and.html) objection.
    - The [cluelessness](https://utilitarianism.net/objections-to-utilitarianism/cluelessness/) objection.
    - The “separateness of persons” objections
        - Agent-neutrality ignores importance of personal projects and relationships.
- We should generally prefer actions make bring about more utility.
    - Harm reduction as a priority.
    - Rights: Rights impose duties on others.
        - But rights are usually not absolute.
    - Virtues: Good but not morally required.
        - Going beyond your moral duties.
        - Avoid extremes: deficiency and excess.

## Deontology

- Greek etymology: deon (duty) logos (principles)
    - Key figure: Immanuel Kant (1724-1804)
    - Difficult to characterize. Often in contrast to consequentalism.
    - Doing the right thing requires following principles of morality.
    - Principles = rules about our moral duties and obligations.
    - Not a matter of consequences. Intention matters.
    - Emphasizes human rational capacity and respect for autonomy.
- Two typical features
    - Moral principles are universal.
        - Non-consequentialist.
        - Absolute, impartial, and applies to everyone.
        - Example: Kant on lying.
    - Human dignity
        - We ought to treat people as ends rather than means.
        - “Mere” means.
- Moral rights
    - Founded on respect for autonomy of rational beings.
    - Rights serve to protect important individual interests.
    - Interests that should not be give up even if the society would be better off.
    - Examples: freedom of thought, speech, movement, association, religion.
    - Rights imply duties (but not in the way commonly understood).
    - Does not imply that rights are absolute: exceptions and balancing.
- Contractualism
    - Morality as a hypothetical social contract.
    - A rational agreement about social structure.
    - Example: State monopoly on the use of force.
    - Key idea: Right actions are those that no one could reasonably reject.
    - Prioritizes fairness and equality.
    - Rawlsian contractualism
        - Equal basic liberties
        - Difference principle (inequality must benefit the worse off)

## Virtue ethics

- Virtue ethics
    - Moral virtues: Generosity, compassion, kindness, courage, …
    - Intellectual virtues: objectivity, curiosity, …
    - Focuses on character of a person.
        - Rather than duties, rules, or consequences.
        - Being a morally good person as the more basic concept.
        - A matter of moral virtues.
        - The morally right thing is what a good person does.
        - Key question: How to develop / perfect moral virtues.
- History
    - Western virtue ethics
        - Originated in ancient Greek philosophy.
        - Primarily with Aristotle (Nicomachean Ethics).
        - Modern revival: Elizabeth Anscombe, Philippa Foot, Alasdair MacIntyre.
        - Feminist virtue ethics.
    - Confucianism as virtue ethics.
        - 五德：仁、義、禮、智、信。
    - Complementary / alternative to other moral frameworks?
    - Practical relevance: professional code of conduct.
        - Example (HK Medical Council): Compassion and loyalty for doctors.
        - Business ethics, politics, education
- Key idea #1: Aristotle’s doctrine of the mean
    - Virtues exist as the “middle measure” (mesotes) between excess and deficiency.
        - Courage: mean between rashness (excess) and cowardice (deficiency).
        - Generosity: mean between wastefulness and stinginess.
        - Justice: giving neither too much nor too little to each person.
    - Not a simple arithmetic mean.
        - What is appropriate in particular situations.
        - Some wrongful actions have no mean (theft, adultery).
    - Confucian connection
        - 中庸：无所偏倚，故谓之中
- Key idea #2: Importance of practical wisdom (phronesis)
    - An intellectual virtue that guides moral decisions.
    - Enables discernment of the right action in concrete situations.
    - Not mere habit. Requires experience and deliberate practice.
- Supererogation and virtue
    - Do we have a duty to be virtuous?
    - Virtuous actions are praiseworthy, but “beyond the call of duty”?
    - Supererogatory actions = good, but not morally required.
    - Failure to perform does not imply blame.
